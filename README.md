# Web Development Curriculum Additions

This presentation details the additions and changes I would make to the full stack web development curriculum.

================================
## Production-Ready Applications
By getting students to research what exactly makes an app ready for production, we would be preparing students for their future as web developers. Although every company or freelancer has different criteria to meet in order to consider their app ready for the client, it is important that students recognize what large changes need to be implemented in order to keep the app deployed and working during updates. Students will get about 15 minutes to research and write their findings to the questions provided. Afterward, the instructor will ask each person in the class to contribute one idea to a production-ready app checklist. Call on more experienced students last. The instructor will then add their ideas to the list and share the file or slideshow to the resources slack channel. 

### Lesson Plan
Students Do: Production-Ready Research Questions (15-20 mins)
Instructor Does: Whole class answers to research questions and slideshow (15 mins)
Groups Do: Production-Ready Prep Activity (30 mins) - Students use the full stack MERN app we've been working on 

================================
## Content Management Systems 
By introducing a CMS to students, we would be providing an authentic learning experience to those who are just acquiring their first jobs in the field as well as freelancing developers. According to W3Techs, a web technology survey provider, WordPress is used by 33.5% of all the websites in existence and has a CMS market share of 60.4% (2019). By ignoring Content Management Systems, full stack developers from bootcamps miss out on the platform that supports a third of all websites in the world. Toward the middle of the course, students feel mostly confident in using the front-end, but they are distracted during the half-days of class during Project 2 week. Rather than jumping directly into QA and testing, I propose that a fun, easy CMS introduction will help students relax and refocus. Testing is a very important section, and it would be best if students could approach it with a refreshed mindset. 

### Lesson Plan 
Instructor Does: Introduce CMS concepts, and demonstrate how to use WordPress (15 mins)
Everyone Does: WordPress Activity (30 mins)
Instructor Does: Whole class questions and clarifications (10-15 mins)

================================
## React Native
The incorporation of React Native into the full stack web development program would help future programmers on their journey to creating versatile, cross-platform applications. While React is useful in the creation of web apps, React Native allows the developer to create an app that is iOS and Android-friendly. This lesson would not require the lengthy installation process of Android Studio and it's emulators. Instead, the class should utilize Expo Snack, an online sandbox emulator. 

### Lesson Plan 
Instructor Does: React vs. React Native Lecture (20 mins)
Everyone Does: React Native Snack Activity (30 mins)
