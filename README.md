# Web Development Curriculum Additions

This presentation details the additions and changes I would make to the full stack web development curriculum.

================================
## Production-Ready Applications
By getting students to research what exactly makes an app ready for production, we would be preparing students for their future as web developers. Although every company or freelancer has different criteria to meet in order to consider their app ready for the client, it is important that students recognize what large changes need to be implemented in order to keep the app deployed and working during updates. Students will get about 15 minutes to research and write their findings to the questions provided. Afterward, the instructor will ask each person in the class to contribute one idea to a production-ready app checklist. Call on more experienced students last. The instructor will then add their ideas to the list and share the file or slideshow to the resources slack channel. 

### Lesson Plan
**Students Do**: Production-Ready Research Questions (15-20 mins) - ./production-ready-questions.txt\
**Instructor Does**: Whole class answers to research questions and slideshow (15 mins) - https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/production-ready-microservices/9781491965962/app01.html\
**Groups Do**: Production-Ready Prep Activity (30 mins) - Students use the full stack MERN app from Week 20 (10-Stu_AJAXFormDelete) and attempt to make it production ready using your checklist or the checklist from the O'Reilly book (linked above). Add testing code, code that explains expected behavior, etc.

================================
## Publishing an NPM Package 
Student will read about and create their very own NPM package that they can use later in their other apps and websites. Through this, students will better understand isolated components and functions before seeing later in the React section. They will gain a better understanding of NPM packages that they have used in the past, such as Moment.js. This activity is useful for deepening understanding, building confidence, gaining bragging rights, and making their coding experience more efficient in the future. 

### Lesson Plan 
**Students Do**: Read the Hackernoon article slacked out in the class-activities channel - https://hackernoon.com/publish-your-own-npm-package-946b19df577e (10 mins)\
**Instructor Does**: Tell students to look at the biolerplate link, explore it for five minutes, then attempt to follow the directions in the article to create their own NPM package! (5 mins)\
**Students Do**: Create and publish an NPM package with at least one function or meaningful variable/component. (40 mins)\
**Everyone Does**: Share and discuss your creations! (5-10 mins)

================================
## React Native
The incorporation of React Native into the full stack web development program would help future programmers on their journey to creating versatile, cross-platform applications. While React is useful in the creation of web apps, React Native allows the developer to create an app that is iOS and Android-friendly. This lesson would not require the lengthy installation process of Android Studio and it's emulators. Instead, the class should utilize Expo Snack, an online sandbox emulator. 

### Lesson Plan 
**Instructor Does**: React vs. React Native Lecture (20 mins) - https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/introduction-to-react-native-95577442 \
**Everyone Does**: React Native Snack Activity (30 mins) - Using expo snack and the React Native documentation, edit the code in the snack emulator. - https://snack.expo.io/ \

================================
SECONDARY OPTION IN PLACE OF PUBLUSHING NPM PACKAGE
## Content Management Systems 
By introducing a CMS to students, we would be providing an authentic learning experience to those who are just acquiring their first jobs in the field as well as freelancing developers. According to W3Techs, a web technology survey provider, WordPress is used by 33.5% of all the websites in existence and has a CMS market share of 60.4% (2019). By ignoring Content Management Systems, full stack developers from bootcamps miss out on the platform that supports a third of all websites in the world. Toward the middle of the course, students feel mostly confident in using the front-end, but they are distracted during the half-days of class during Project 2 week. Rather than jumping directly into QA and testing, I propose that a fun, easy CMS introduction will help students relax and refocus. Testing is a very important section, and it would be best if students could approach it with a refreshed mindset. 

### Lesson Plan 
**Instructor Does**: Introduce CMS concepts, and demonstrate how to use WordPress using an admin account on a small website. (15 mins)\
**Everyone Does**: WordPress Activity - Add students as admins to the site and allow them to add or clone a page on the website and experiment with layouts on a site that is already in a production setting. (30 mins)\
**Instructor Does**: Whole class questions and clarifications (10-15 mins)
